# VisionX (Android Application for real time buildings recognition)
VisionX is my final year project. It is basically an Android Application
developed in flutter. The application uses Machine Learning, Deep Learning and 
Computer Vision (Object Detection) techniques to detect and recognize a building.

The upgradation is still in process. I will soon add the proper working, 
manual, dependencies and other stuff related to the project here.
